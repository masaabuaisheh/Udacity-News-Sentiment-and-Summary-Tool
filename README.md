# Project Title

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive guide to setting up a modern web application with Webpack, Sass, and API integration. You will learn how to configure Webpack, use Sass for styling, work with Webpack loaders and plugins, and integrate Natural Language Processing (NLP) APIs for dynamic data analysis.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-folder>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Webpack Configuration**
   Follow the setup steps provided in the course to configure Webpack. Make sure to refer to the course repository for guidance.

## API Setup

### Aylien API

1. **Sign Up for an API Key**
   - Visit [Aylien](https://aylien.com/) and sign up to obtain an API key.

2. **Install the SDK**
   ```bash
   npm install aylien_textapi
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root of your project:
     ```
     API_ID=your-api-id
     API_KEY=your-api-key
     ```
   - Update your `.gitignore` to include `.env` to keep your keys secure.

4. **Set Up the SDK in Your Server**
   ```javascript
   const dotenv = require('dotenv');
   dotenv.config();
   const aylien = require('aylien_textapi');

   const textapi = new aylien({
     application_id: process.env.API_ID,
     application_key: process.env.API_KEY
   });
   ```

### MeaningCloud API

1. **Sign Up for a License Key**
   - Visit [MeaningCloud](https://www.meaningcloud.com/) to get your license key.

2. **Install `form-data` Module**
   ```bash
   npm install form-data
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Build for Production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Testing**
   Make sure to test the server and form submissions. Handle any errors or incorrect user inputs gracefully.

## Service Workers

Add service worker configuration to your Webpack setup for offline support and caching. This step will ensure that your site remains available even when the local server is stopped.

## Deployment
